*   The `typing_game` and `vim_key_mapping_game` are integrated with the game engine.
*   A high score system has been implemented and integrated into both games.
*   The UI has been improved with colored output and better formatting.
*   Post-game experience enhanced: score displayed, play again/main menu options provided.

## What's Left to Build

*   More games.
