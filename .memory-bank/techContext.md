# Tech Context

## Technologies Used

- **Lua:** The primary programming language for the mini-games and the core framework.
- **JSON:** Used for data serialization, specifically for storing high scores.

## Development Setup

- **Lua Interpreter:** A standard Lua 5.x interpreter is required to run the games.
- **Text Editor/IDE:** Any text editor or IDE with Lua support can be used for development.

## Technical Constraints

- **Command-Line Interface:** The games are designed to run in a command-line environment, limiting graphical capabilities.
- **Lua Standard Libraries:** Reliance primarily on Lua's standard libraries to maintain portability and simplicity.
- **File System Access:** Games will require read/write access to the file system for high score persistence.
