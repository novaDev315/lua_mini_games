# Project Brief

This project is a collection of mini-games implemented in Lua. The goal is to provide a simple framework for creating and playing small, text-based games.

## Core Requirements

- **Game Selection:** Users should be able to select from a list of available mini-games.
- **Game Execution:** Each selected game should run independently.
- **Modularity:** The project structure should be modular, allowing for easy addition of new games and shared utilities.
- **High Scores:** Games should be able to track and display high scores.
- **User Interface:** A basic text-based user interface for navigation and game interaction.
